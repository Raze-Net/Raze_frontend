# Raze_frontend

This repo will present the front end and UI that can interact with Raze protocol. We will implement the client that supports the Register, CreateMintTx, CreateTransferTx, CreateRedeemTx, CreateLockTx, and CreateUnlockTx algorithms. The client will be able to generate the necessary transactions to trigger the corresponding substrate modules. The transaction will include all the zero-knowledge proofs generated for these modules. We will provide a basic UI to take inputs from the users for the proof generation algorithms.
